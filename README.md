# python-challenge
This is the assignment for Module 3. 

There are two folders here, corresponding to two tasks. Each folder contains a file named main.py, which is a Python script. The files in the resources folder are datasets, and the files in the analysis folder are text files generated as output results based on the code.

To run main.py successfully, please use "pwd" to check the path and make sure you are in or cd to the "python-challenge" folder. Otherwise, there may be path-related issues.

**One thing to note: in the PyPoll task, the main.py script uses the "numpy" module, which may cause an issue of "numpy not installed". Please download and install numpy first before running this script.**
